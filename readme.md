# OpenGL shadows example

`Matrix` and `Vector` classes were taken from [this tutorial](http://masandilov.ru/opengl/opengl-shadows)

Code was tested on Visual Studio 2017

## Installing OpenGL

* Use NuGet Package Manager (built in VS)
* Open its console and type `Package-Install nupengl.core`
* That's all :)
